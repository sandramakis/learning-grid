            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny's worth

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the Bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            excellence experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best- and most grueling -time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VE setup."

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
            Getting the guidance from them and learning from their experiences
            was easy.

            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
            be able to go back in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
            and amazing people."

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developer
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended"
